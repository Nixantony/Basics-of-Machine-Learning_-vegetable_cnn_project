Project Title: Vegetable Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

â¸»

Project Overview:
This project is a basic image classification system that uses deep learning to identify different types of vegetables from images. The main goal is to automate vegetable recognition for real-world use cases like grocery apps, smart farming, and food packaging. The model is trained on images of 15 vegetable categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Key Features:
- Recognizes 15 common vegetables based on image input.
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Includes a Jupyter notebook for training and testing.
- Comes with a simple prediction script for trying your own images.
- Optional web interface built with Streamlit for demo purposes.
